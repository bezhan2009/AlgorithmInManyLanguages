A comprehensive collection of a single algorithm implemented in 100 different programming languages. This project showcases the syntactic and stylistic differences across various programming languages.

## Algorithm

The selected algorithm is implemented in 100 different programming languages. The main goal is to demonstrate the diversity and unique features of each language through a common task.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! If you would like to add an implementation in a new language, please follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Create a directory for the new language (if it doesn't already exist).
3. Add the implementation of the algorithm in the new directory.
4. Submit a pull request with a clear description of the changes.

Please ensure that your code follows the standard conventions and includes comments where necessary.
