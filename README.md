This repository showcases sorting algorithms implemented in 100 different programming languages. Each language directory contains a basic sorting algorithm implementation to illustrate language-specific features and syntax.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to explore and compare sorting algorithm implementations across a diverse set of programming languages, from mainstream languages to more exotic ones.

## Directory Structure

Each language directory includes:
- `README.md`: Explanation of the sorting algorithm implemented in that language.
- Source code file (`sort.xyz`): Implementation of the sorting algorithm.
- Example input and output files (`input.xyz`, `output.xyz`).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you know a programming language that isn't covered yet or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to fork this repository, add your implementation, and submit a pull request.
