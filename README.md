This repository showcases sorting algorithms implemented in 100 different programming languages. Each language directory contains a basic sorting algorithm implementation to illustrate language-specific features and syntax.


## Directory Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `A/`: Algorithms implemented in languages starting with 'A'
- `B/`: Algorithms implemented in languages starting with 'B'
- ...
- `Z/`: Algorithms implemented in languages starting with 'Z'

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to explore and compare sorting algorithm implementations across a diverse set of programming languages, from mainstream languages to more exotic ones.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you know a programming language that isn't covered yet or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to fork this repository, add your implementation, and submit a pull request.
